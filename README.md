# 🛡️ Snow Crash – 42 Cybersecurity Project

This repository contains my writeups and solutions for the **Snow Crash** project at [1337 Coding School](https://x.com/1337FIL).
The goal of this project is to introduce students to the world of cybersecurity through hands-on challenges involving privilege escalation, reverse engineering, and vulnerability analysis.

## 📖 Project Description

In this project, I am dropped into a custom Linux virtual machine with multiple users (`level00` to `level14`), each having limited privileges.  
The objective is to find a way to gain access to the next level by exploiting system flaws or vulnerabilities, and ultimately collect a **flag** using the `getflag` command.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

.
├── level00/
│ ├── flag
│ └── resources/
├── level01/
│ ├── flag
│ └── resources/
...
└── level14/


Each level includes:
- `flag`: The password/token retrieved using `getflag`.
- `resources/`: All files used to solve the level (proof of concept, commands, notes, etc.).
